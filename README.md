# BitVis

Key insights in the crypto currency world.

Charts powered by [Highcharts](highcharts.com/demo/line-basic).
UI powered by [Preact](preactjs.com) and [Preact-Router](github.com/developit/preact-router).
Development powered by [Babel](babeljs.io), [Webpack](webpack.github.io), [Yarn](yarnpkg.com), and [create-preact-app](github.com/alexkuz/create-preact-app).

## Run Locally
1. `git clone git@github.com:chrisisler/bitvis`
2. `yarn ; yarn start`

### Todo
- Put "Tools" section of blockchain.info/q into a separate view.
- make charts work

#### What I Learned

- Inline styles with vanillajs objects cannot do things like `:hover`.
